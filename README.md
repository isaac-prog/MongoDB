## Deployment
Using heroku for Express, follow the steps:

Step 1| Log into Heroku
At the terminal, log in to heroku with:

heroku login -i

Enter your username and password.

Step 2| Create the Heroku App
Once you have logged in, create a new Heroku app with the following commands at the terminal:

heroku create <app-name>

Step 3| Define Procfile
The Procfile executes a command when Heroku needs to run our server. Create one in the same directory as index.js and name it as Procfile (the first alphabet must be capitalized, and there is no extension).

Add the following line to the Procfile:

web: node index.js


Make sure to save the Procfile

Step 4| Add a start script to package.json


  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js"


Step 5| Change the port that we are using

Change the 3000 in app.listen to process.env.PORT

Step 6| Push to Heroku

Make sure you have a .gitignore file, and it must have node_modules, sessions/ and .env included,

git add .
git commit -m "Deployment to Heroku"
git push heroku master

Step 7| Setup the config variables
We need to duplicate the content of the .env file inside the config variables section of Heroku.

Go to Heroku and look for the app you just deployed. Then click on Settings:

Next, click on Reveal Config Vars:

After which, add in MONGO_URL, and the connection URL from your .env file:

Step 7| Run the app
From your Heroku project panel, click on the button that says Open App. Test if your app is working.
